why did float left for the search box work but not margin left or text align left?
gotten to a point where heroku seems like it sis going to work. now the process env that was working for me before is no longer working
display inline to get two p tags side by side

think i get the logic of the nav switch now. switchview says on click, change the currentView state. currentView in dashboard says if currentView is this, make the dashboard this component
so switchView will change the state and whatever state currentVIEW is, if you AND it with the component it will display that componenet
i can change view to artistDetail from tracks like i did with the rest. lets see..
I might have to use redux. Bummer
process.env variable was undefined because i did npm install dotenv instead of npm install dotenv save
to force two elements to stay on the same line you must put a * beside whatever selector you are using e.g .makeHorizontal * {}
try and implement dry principle as soon as you can
